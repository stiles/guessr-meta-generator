# GeoGuessr tools

This repository contains a growing set of tools aimed at understanding and boosting play on GeoGuessr, a game that challenges users to recognize locations from Google Street View's panoramic images. 

The project was born out of a desire to help my kids better understand geography, but it has turned into an experiement in using AI tools to generate structured data â€” in this case hints for identifying world countries and US states on the roadways. It also helps explore your own Geoguessr duels. 

The project, for now, includes scripts to collect and generate game-specific metadata about counties and US states. It also contains code to create a simple country mapping quiz and a filterable grid of national flags, with country-specific pages baked into static files. In addition, there are scripts to fetch details about specific duels or to compile a dataframe of all of your duels. 

*It's very new and a work in progress.*
